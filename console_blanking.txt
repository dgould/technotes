HOWTO: Install service to disable console blanking

Blanking the console ("for power-saving") is a nice idea when needed, but it's
annoying and potentially dangerous, because if you can't see the console's
content, you can't know its state, and therefore can't know what keypress is
safe. It's especially pointless for VMs, where the console is virtual anyway.
This one was surprisingly complicated. 

First part of solution is that blanking can be disabled via:

$ setterm -blank 0 -powersave off -powerdown 0

But that's just for the session. Getting it to happen at startup required
learning how to write an init script. Which is plenty useful in its own right,
so let's document it here. Ref:
http://www.groupsrv.com/linux/about159299.html

Key points:
* init scripts go in /etc/init.d/
* to be valid for chkconfig, init scripts must have an INIT INFO comment block
* an init script is registered as a service via $ chkconfig --add $NAME
* the service can then be started/stopped via $ service $NAME (start|stop)
* and its autostart behavior can be set via $ chkconfig $NAME (on|off) 

Combining info from a few refs, I created this script. (Per one of the
comments, the loop may or may not be necessary -- someone claims the setting
is global to all tty's.):

----- BEGIN SCRIPT "my_setterm" -----
#!/bin/sh

### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides: my_setterm
# Required-Start:
# Required-Stop:
# Default-Start: 3 5
# Default-Stop: 0 1 2 6
# Short-Description: disable console blanking
# Description: ref.
# http://superuser.com/questions/152347/change-linux-console-screen-blanking-behavior
# http://www.groupsrv.com/linux/about159299.html
### END INIT INFO

[ "$1" == "start" ] || exit 0 # only initialize everything when called as
/etc/init.d/setterm start

for term in /dev/tty[0-9]*; do # select all ttyNN, but skip ttyS*
        setterm -blank 0 >$term <$term
        setterm -powersave off >$term <$term
        setterm -powerdown 0 >$term <$term
done
----- END SCRIPT "my_setterm" -----

And I installed it thusly:

1. put the script in /etc/init.d/my_setterm
2. $ chmod 755 /etc/init.d/my_setterm
3. $ chkconfig --add my_setterm
4. $ chkconfig my_setterm on
5. $ service my_setterm start 

From then on, no blanking. Even right after a reboot, before logging in. I've
made this part of my routine for all new VMs I create, right after installing
the guest OS and VMWare tools.
